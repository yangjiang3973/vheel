Show you how to create a vue3-similar framework step by step

## Introduction

[中文简介](https://github.com/yangjiang3973/vheel/blob/main/README-zh.md)

I found a lot of people are interested in how Vue3 or other UI frameworks are built,

but it is not easy to read source code directly and understand the overall logic within a short time.

So I am here to use a progressive way to show you how to build a vue3-similar framework.

## How to use

Each branch is like a small milestone that shows the progress of development, while main branch always has the lastest code.

I suggest you to clone the repo to your local machine and start from branch `01-setup-dev-env`.

In `vheel/playground/main.js` I usually create a demo to show the new features in this branch.

To run it, first run

`npm install`

then,

`npm run dev`

## Articles

I also wrote some articles to explain what I did in each branch and why.

But so far all articles are still in Mandarin(I will put them in issues section).

Later when I have time, I will translate them all into English.
